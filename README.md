## Description

This is an app to solve the first world problem of being able to see the descriptions of digital content we consume.
To that end, this app allows us to add movies to our collection, edit the descriptions, and sort by genre (functionality to be added with later updates).

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
